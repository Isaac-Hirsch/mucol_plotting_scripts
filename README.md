# mucol_plotting_scripts

TBD

# For plotting with python notebooks

## For analysis in a python notebook only with uproot
- I have homebrew installed python3 and anaconda
- I used anaconda's pip, to ```pip install uproot```
Start a notebook with 
```
jupyter notebook
```

## If you want to use a python notebook with ROOT
you can open a notebook with 
```
root --notebook
```
